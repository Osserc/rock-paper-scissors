# rock-paper-scissors
I made a little Rock, Paper, Scissors game through javascripts.
I experimented with nesting functions and loops.
The outcome of each singular game is tracked, and it ends at 5 or when a contestant reaches a score of 3, and then the results are presented.
To see the outcomes you must have the console open, as they are presented through console.log commands.
One day the game will have more bite and character, so stay tuned!
