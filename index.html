    <div class="intro"><p>Welcome to the Coliseum, magister!</p>
        <p>Your three champions will do their best to ensure your triumph against Veknos' goons!</p>
        <p>Do keep in mind that while they are all great fighters, they all have their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p>Warrior excels against rogues, but suffer against mages; rogues are great at taking down wizards but stand no chance when facing a warrior; and while wizards may handily dispatch warriors, they will quickly be brought down by a rogue.</p>
        <p>The challenge will proceed as follows: each turn, you will select one of your champions to enter the arena, as will Veknos; the first team to reach 5 victories will be declared the winner.</p>
        <p>But enough talk! Let's get on with the games!</p>
